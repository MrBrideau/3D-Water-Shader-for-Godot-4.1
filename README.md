# 3D-Water-Shader-for-Godot-4.1

Makes a 3D mesh behave like water.

# Important instructions
You need to take into account that the more dense in polygons the mesh is, the more "realistic" the waves looks. 
If you cannot draw good water textures to save your life, you can just generate a noise map and achieve a decent effect.
